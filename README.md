# VIP Governance plugin

This is a WordPress plugin that's meant to add in governance within the Block Editor, specifically for two dimensions:

- Insertion: This adds the ability to restrict what kind of blocks can be inserted into the block editor. Only whatâ€™s allowed can be inserted, and nothing else. This means that even if new core blocks are introduced or existing ones are modified, they would not be permitted.
- Interaction: This adds the ability to control the styling available for blocks at any level. This also has an extra addition on top which we call lockdown mode, that will disable any kind of interaction including block movements, unless you have permission to do so.

## Installation

The latest version of the VIP Governance plugin is available in the default `trunk` branch of this repository.

### Install via `git subtree`

We recommend installing the latest plugin version [via `git subtree`][wpvip-plugin-subtrees] within your site's repository:

```bash
# Enter your project's root directory:
cd my-site-repo/

# Add a subtree for the trunk branch:
git subtree add --prefix plugins/vip-governance git@github.com:wpcomvip/vip-governance-plugin.git trunk --squash
```

To deploy the plugin to a remote branch, `git push` the committed subtree.

The `trunk` branch will stay up to date with the latest version of the plugin. Use this command to pull the latest `trunk` branch changes:

```bash
git subtree pull --prefix plugins/vip-governance git@github.com:wpcomvip/vip-governance-plugin.git trunk --squash
```

Ensure that the plugin is up-to-date by pulling changes often.

Note: We **do not recommend** using `git submodule`. [Submodules on WPVIP that require authentication][wpvip-plugin-submodules] will fail to deploy.

### Install via ZIP file

The latest version of the plugin can be downloaded from the [repository's Releases page][repo-releases]. Unzip the downloaded plugin and add it to the `plugins/` directory of your site's GitHub repository.

### Plugin activation

Usually VIP recommends [activating plugins with code][wpvip-plugin-activate]. In this case, we are recommending activating the plugin in the WordPress Admin dashboard. This will allow the plugin to be more easily enabled and disabled during testing.

To activate the installed plugin:

1. Navigate to the WordPress Admin dashboard as a logged-in user.
2. Select **Plugins** from the lefthand navigation menu.
3. Locate the "VIP Governance" plugin in the list and select the "Activate" link located below it.

## Usage

In order to start using this plugin, you'll need to create `governance-rules.json` in your private folder. We have provided some examples [here][repo-examples] that you can use as a starting point.

### Examples

#### Default

This is breaking down the default[`governance-rules.json`][repo-default-example].

With this default rule set, you'll get the following rules:

- All blocks are allowed to be inserted across all the roles. 
- There are no restrictions, including on what children are allowed under a block.

#### Example 1

This is breaking down [example-1.json][repo-example-1]. 

With this example, you'll get the following rules:

- Default: This is going to apply to everyone as a baseline. Heading/paragraph blocks are allowed, and for a heading a custom red colour will appear as a possible text colour option.
- Editor/Administrator role: Besides the default allowed blocks, quote/media-text and image blocks will be allowed as well. A heading sitting inside a media-text will be allowed to have a custom red colour as it's text. But the default rule of custom red for a heading at the root level will also appear. In addition to that, a media-text block will be allowed to have paragraph, heading, and image as children and a quote block will be allowed to have paragraph, and heading as children.

### Schema Definition

You can find the schema that's used for validating the rules [here][repo-schema-location]. This will help you in crafting up the custom rules file if the example provided above is not sufficient.

## Development

In order to ensure no dev dependencies go in, the following can be done while installing the packages:

```
composer install --no-dev
```

### Tests

Run tests locally with [`wp-env`][wp-env] and Docker:

```
wp-env start
composer install
composer run test
```
