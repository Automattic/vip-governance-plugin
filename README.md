# VIP Governance plugin

This is a plugin that's meant to add in Governance features into Gutenberg. At the moment, it adds the ability to style nested blocks using a file called `insteractions-governance.json` at the root of the plugin itself.

## Setup

Place this plugin in the plugins directory of your site and run the following:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build

# For watching and building on change:
$ npm start
```

Ensure that both Gutenberg and this plugin are then activated for your site.
